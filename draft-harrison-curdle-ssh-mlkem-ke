--- abstract

This document defines Post-Quantum key exchange methods based on 
Module-lattice post-quantum key encapsulation schemes.  These methods
are defined for use in the SSH Transport Layer Protocol.

# Introduction

Should the sufficiently large quantum computers become available, the existing key exchange algorithms would be in jeopardy of being rendered insecure. While we do not yet have such computers, we look to prevent "harvest-now-decrypt-later" attacks by leveraging post-quamtum algorithms for key exchange methods or key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs ) [NIST_PQ] in SSH.

The post-quantum KEM referenced in the document is ML-KEM. We are discussing the three standardized parameter variants ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM 1024. [FIPS203]

This memo includes requests of IANA to register new method names
"ml-kem512-sha256", "ml-kem768-sha256", "ml-kem1024-sha384", and
to be registered by IANA in the "Key Exchange Method Names" registry
for SSH [IANA-SSH].
